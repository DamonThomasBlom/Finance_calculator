# Finance calculator
With this project I was given a task to create an application that allows the user to access two
different financial calculators: 
1. Investment calculator 
2. Home loan repayment calculator

## How the programme works
First you are given the option to pick what would you like to calculate
as shown above, once you select an option the programme will then ask you
for relevant information needed to calculate what you selected and if you 
selected the investment option it will also ask you 'Simple' or 'Compound interest'.
After you have entered in all the information it will then do all the calculations and
display your final amount 
> Note: Everything is displayed in South African currency (R)
